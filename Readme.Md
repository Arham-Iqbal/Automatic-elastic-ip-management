# Automating Elastic IP Management

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to automate the process of managing Elastic IPs (EIPs) in AWS using Python and Boto3. Elastic IPs are static public IP addresses that can be moved between instances, providing a consistent IP address even if instances change. The project includes allocating, associating, disassociating, and releasing Elastic IPs with an EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account to allocate and manage Elastic IPs.
- **AWS IAM User**: Set up an IAM user with the necessary permissions to manage EC2 and Elastic IPs.
- **AWS CLI Configured**: Ensure the AWS CLI is installed and configured with your credentials.
- **Python Installed**: Python 3.x should be installed on your machine.
- **Boto3 Installed**: Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, should be installed.

Install Boto3 using pip if you haven't:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

## Script Usage

The script performs the following actions:

1. **Allocate a New Elastic IP**: Reserves an Elastic IP address within your AWS VPC.
2. **Associate the Elastic IP with an EC2 Instance**: Assigns the allocated Elastic IP to a specified EC2 instance.
3. **Disassociate and Release the Elastic IP**: Optionally disassociates the Elastic IP from the instance and releases it back to AWS.

### Code

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, ClientError

# Initialize a session using Boto3
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='your-region')

try:
    # Allocate a new Elastic IP
    allocation = ec2.allocate_address(Domain='vpc')
    print(f"Allocated Elastic IP: {allocation['PublicIp']} with Allocation ID: {allocation['AllocationId']}")

    # Associate the Elastic IP with an EC2 instance
    instance_id = 'your-instance-id'  # Replace with your instance ID
    association = ec2.associate_address(
        InstanceId=instance_id,
        AllocationId=allocation['AllocationId']
    )
    print(f"Elastic IP {allocation['PublicIp']} associated with Instance ID: {instance_id}")

    # Optionally, disassociate and release the Elastic IP
    # Disassociate the Elastic IP
    ec2.disassociate_address(AssociationId=association['AssociationId'])
    print(f"Elastic IP {allocation['PublicIp']} disassociated from Instance ID: {instance_id}")

    # Release the Elastic IP
    ec2.release_address(AllocationId=allocation['AllocationId'])
    print(f"Released Elastic IP: {allocation['PublicIp']}")

except NoCredentialsError:
    print("Credentials not available.")
except ClientError as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

### Explanation

- **Allocate a New Elastic IP**: The script uses `ec2.allocate_address(Domain='vpc')` to allocate a new Elastic IP in your VPC.
- **Associate with an EC2 Instance**: It then associates the allocated Elastic IP with a specified EC2 instance using `ec2.associate_address(...)`.
- **Disassociate and Release the Elastic IP**: The script optionally disassociates the Elastic IP from the instance and releases it using `ec2.disassociate_address(...)` and `ec2.release_address(...)`.

### Exception Handling

The script includes exception handling for:

- **NoCredentialsError**: Triggered if AWS credentials are not found.
- **ClientError**: Catches any AWS-related errors, such as incorrect instance ID or service issues.

## How to Run

1. Replace `'your-region'` with your AWS region (e.g., `'us-west-2'`).
2. Replace `'your-instance-id'` with the EC2 instance ID you want to associate the Elastic IP with.
3. Run the script in your Python environment.

```bash
python automate_eip_management.py
```

## Real-Life Use Cases

- **Failover Systems**: Quickly switch Elastic IPs between instances during failover events.
- **Rotating IPs**: Automate the rotation of IP addresses to avoid blacklisting or reduce exposure to attacks.
- **Cost Management**: Release unused Elastic IPs to avoid unnecessary charges.

## Conclusion

This project provides a practical example of automating Elastic IP management in AWS, a critical task for maintaining high availability and flexible network configurations. By running this script, you'll gain hands-on experience with AWS networking and Python automation using Boto3.
